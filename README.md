My Web Development Project:
- Purpose: The purpose of my web application is to give our users the oppurtunity to achieve the goals they
- want to realize and so they can learn fro their past.
- We achieve this by giving them the oppurtunity to take notes and to write their goals they want to achieve 
and we also provide a scheduler where they can plan their day to day plans.
We used Django, React, HTML and css to develop our web application.



How to run it:

- First Git Clone our repo

- cd to frontend and run "npm install" in the terminal.

- go back to main folder and run "python manage.py runserver" to deploy your backend


- Then cd to frontend and run "npm start" in the terminal to deploy the frontend 

- The webapp should open in local host.


- Then register with your ceredentials and login to web app.


- Horray you can use our web app NOW!
